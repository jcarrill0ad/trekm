title: Rails Foundations Workshops - Winter 2010
---
<p>If you&#8217;re in South East Michigan and serious about learning (or better understanding) Rails our upcoming <a href="http://backtik.github.com"><em>Rails Foundations</em></a> workshop series is for you.</p>

<p>This season, we're trying something new: name your own price workshops</p>

<p>In the past we've offered the workshop for free and for pay. When free, we fill up same day and usually have 20+ people on the wait list.  When we charge we end up with about half as many participants as we'd like.  In the spirit of adventure (and capitalism!) we're letting people name their own price.  $5? $50? $5000? Totally up to you.</p>

<p>At the end of a short bidding period, we're going to take a group of top bidders, and charge them all the lowest price from the group.</p>

<p><em>Rails Foundations</em> focuses on giving attendees a solid understanding of major Rails components and how they interrelate. You&#8217;ll find we teach no Rails magic, trickery, or shortcuts.</p>

<p>We have a different approach for Rails training than most shops.  If you&#8217;re looking for a grand tour of Rails, we recommended <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/classes/beginning_ruby_on_rails.shtml">Big Nerd Ranch</a>, the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/rails">Pragmatic Studio</a>, or fellow Michiganders <a href="http://ideafoundry.info/ruby-on-rails">Idea Foundry</a>.  If you want to explore just the core Rails concepts in greater depth (preparing you to do wider exploration on your own), we think you&#8217;ll enjoy the series.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve never used Rails before, the workshops are right for you if</p>

<ul>
<li>You&#8217;ve programmed in an OOP language</li>
<li>You&#8217;ve written for the web, but didn&#8217;t really use HTTP fully</li>
<li>You like to keep up on current trends in development</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#8217;ve programmed in Rails, the workshops will clear up some misconceptions if</p>

<ul>
<li>Your controllers have goofy actions like <code>javascript_save</code> and <code>about_us</code></li>
<li>Your routes don&#8217;t go beyond <code>map.connect ':controller/:action/:id'</code></li>
<li>Your views are so abstracted you&#8217;re not sure <em>what</em> HTML they even output anymore</li>
<li>You didn&#8217;t know that <code>belongs_to</code> is actually a class method that takes a symbol as its first argument</li>
</ul>

<p>The course starts is just under two weeks, so <a href="http://backtik.github.com">grab a spot quickly</a>!</p>
