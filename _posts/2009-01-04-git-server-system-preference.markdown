title: Git Server System Preference
---
If you need a way to temporarily host a few git projects (for coworking or meetups, perhaps) my company has released a version of our <a href='http://github.com/trek/gitserver-prefpane/tree/master'>git server preference pane</a> for MacOS 10.5.

It's not intended to be as extensive  as <a href='http://scie.nti.st/2007/11/14/hosting-git-repositories-the-easy-and-secure-way'>Gitosis</a> or <a href='http://github.com/dysinger/gitorious/tree/master'>Gitorious</a> but is nicely suited if you want to host a project temporarily while working out ideas before pushing a major commit to a repository with more uses. That is, after all, the promise of distributed source control.

Download <a href='http://github.com/trek/gitserver-prefpane/tree/master'>the source</a> or <a href='http://backtik.s3.amazonaws.com/GitServer.zip'>the compiled preference pane</a>
