title: Sceencast - Red In Action (fixed)
---
<a href="http://github.com/backtik/redshift/tree/master">Redshift</a>, our Ruby library for DOM scripting, is ready for public release.  To celebrate this event we've created a screencast so everyone can see Red/Redshift in action. Seeing is believing:

See it on <a href='http://vimeo.com/2189212'>Vimeo</a> (where you can also download a full .mov version).

The code for this project is stored on my github account: <a href="http://github.com/trek/red-sample-apps/tree/master">Grab it</a>.
