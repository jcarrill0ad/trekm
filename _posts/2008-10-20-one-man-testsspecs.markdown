title: One Man Tests/Specs
---
I was talking to a friend about testing/speccing in projects where there is only a single coder. He asked whether writing tests/specs was worth the effort on a one man project.

There's no such thing as a one-man project. Every project will always have at least two developers: you and past-you.  The sucky thing about past-you is that he's always a worse programmer than you.  You will be constantly frustrated by past-you's work and wonder why he didn't take advantage of some <em>very</em> obvious ways of accomplishing a task.  Worst of all, you will never able to ask him what he was thinking; trust me, he <em>will</em> have moved on.

Always ensure that past-you has written tests or specs (and good comments!). Otherwise you risk breaking his cockamamie work.
