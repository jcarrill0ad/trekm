title: Depressed about Michigan
---
I just got word of an <a href="http://srtstimulus.eventbrite.com/">upcoming career development event</a> taking place in south-east Michigan next week and it's made me mildly depressed about the state of the software development industry in my area.

On one hand, I'm glad to see <a href='http://srtsolutions.com/'>someone</a> offering low-cost continuing education events. On the other hand it's 2009: there should not be a developer <em>left</em> in this industry who hasn't already investigated and/or implemented most of these techniques already on her (or his) own time or as part of a workplace requirement to remain updated on current industry trends.

You <em>can't</em> talk about "version control, continuous integration, and automated testing" as "new techniques" just like you can't talk about "C#, Java, Python, Scala, GWT, Silverlight," as "new languages".

Sad Panda.
