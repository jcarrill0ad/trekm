title: Rails Foundations Workshops
---
<p>If you&#8217;re in South East Michigan and serious about learning (or better understanding) Rails our upcoming <a href="http://register.backtik.com/rails-july-2009/"><em>Rails Foundations</em></a> workshop series is for you.  In the past we&#8217;ve only offered this workshop to our friends and colleagues or by recommendation.  Based on the feedback of some people we highly respect we&#8217;ve decided to make this series generally available.</p>

<p><em>Rails Foundations</em> focuses on giving attendees a solid understanding of major Rails components and how they interrelate. You&#8217;ll find we teach no Rails magic, trickery, or shortcuts.</p>

<p>We have a different approach for Rails training than most shops.  If you&#8217;re looking for a grand tour of Rails, we recommended <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/classes/beginning_ruby_on_rails.shtml">Big Nerd Ranch</a>, the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/rails">Pragmatic Studio</a>, or fellow Michiganders <a href="http://ideafoundry.info/ruby-on-rails">Idea Foundry</a>.  If you want to explore just the core Rails concepts in greater depth (preparing you to do wider exploration on your own), we think you&#8217;ll enjoy the series.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve never used Rails before, the workshops are right for you if</p>

<ul>
<li>You&#8217;ve programmed in an OOP language</li>
<li>You&#8217;ve written for the web, but didn&#8217;t really use HTTP fully</li>
<li>You like to keep up on current trends in development</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#8217;ve programmed in Rails, the workshops will clear up some misconceptions if</p>

<ul>
<li>Your controllers have goofy actions like <code>javascript_save</code> and <code>about_us</code></li>
<li>Your routes don&#8217;t go beyond <code>map.connect ':controller/:action/:id'</code></li>
<li>Your views are so abstracted you&#8217;re not sure <em>what</em> HTML they even output anymore</li>
<li>You didn&#8217;t know that <code>belongs_to</code> is actually a class method that takes a symbol as its first argument</li>
</ul>

<p>The course starts is just under two weeks, so <a href="http://register.backtik.com/rails-july-2009/">grab a spot quickly</a>!</p>
