<a href="http://localhost/~trek/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/img_0231.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-95 alignleft" title="img_0231" src="http://localhost/~trek/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/img_0231.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="233" /></a>Today I saw Dell's new <a href="http://gizmodo.com/393815/exclusive-dell-mini-inspiron-their-first-mini-laptop">little mini laptop</a> in the wild. I've wanted one, but seeing it in person I think it's too small for me to do work on.

Great for a small email/IM/web machine though.
